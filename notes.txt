Entity Actions require:
    * Entity being acted on
    * Stage on which the action is taking place
        - If the entity has a reference to its own level, this is superfluous.
    * Additional information for the specific action

AI, in order to generate an action, thus require:
    * The entity associated with that AI
    * The level on which the entity is on
    * Additional information generated when determining action.

NPC:
    AIController controller;
    Stage level;
    controller.nextAction(this, level);

Rendering notes:
    * GameScreen has everything necessary to draw the roguelike adventure screen.
    * Thus it has:
        Level
            * Tiles
            * Entities
            * Items
        Other UI elements
            * Player stats
            * Player Skills

Level:
    * Consider just having a map of Position -> Tile.
    * Same with Position -> Actor, or Actor -> Position?

Stats:
    * They have a value that can be modified permanently or temporarily.
        * Examples:
            MaxHealth increases by 10 on level up, permanently.
            Strength increases by 5 for 10 turns after casting Might
            AC increases by 5 while armor is equipped
            When poisoned, Health decreased by 5 per turn.
    * Stat changes can be applied:
        Instantly
            Example: MaxHealth increases by 10 on level up.
                        Health decreases by 7 when hit with a sword
        Temporarily:
            Example: Might grants 10 strength for 10 turns
                        Decay reduces MaxHealth by 20% for 5 turns
        Persistently
            Example: Poison deals 5 damage per turn for 10 turns

    * They can relate to one another
        * Health must be <= MaxHealth
    * A single effect can modify multiple stats
        * Blindness decreases EV and To-Hit by 5 for 10 turns
    * This tells me that we need the following:
        * Value: The current value of the stat
        * RecurringEffects: These are effects that apply a delta on a tick (with possible delay)
            * Example: Poison decreases health by 5 per turn for 5 turns
        * PermanentEffects: These are effects that are a constant modifier (e.g. from equipped armor, from a spell that falls off)
            * Example:
                Might increases strength by 5 for 5 turns
                Armor increased by 5 when helmet equipped
