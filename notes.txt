Entity Actions require:
    * Entity being acted on
    * Stage on which the action is taking place
        - If the entity has a reference to its own level, this is superfluous.
    * Additional information for the specific action

AI, in order to generate an action, thus require:
    * The entity associated with that AI
    * The level on which the entity is on
    * Additional information generated when determining action.

NPC:
    AIController controller;
    Stage level;
    controller.nextAction(this, level);

Rendering notes:
    * GameScreen has everything necessary to draw the roguelike adventure screen.
    * Thus it has:
        Level
            * Tiles
            * Entities
            * Items
        Other UI elements
            * Player stats
            * Player Skills

Level:
    * Consider just having a map of Position -> Tile.
    * Same with Position -> Actor, or Actor -> Position?

    Entities have Attributes // E.g. Health, MaxHealth
    Entities have Abilities // E.g. Attack, CastSpell
