Entity Actions require:
    * Entity being acted on
    * Stage on which the action is taking place
        - If the entity has a reference to its own stage, this is superfluous.
    * Additional information for the specific action

AI, in order to generate an action, thus require:
    * The entity associated with that AI
    * The stage on which the entity is on
    * Additional information generated when determining action.


NPC:
    AIController controller;
    Stage stage;
    controller.nextAction(this, stage);
